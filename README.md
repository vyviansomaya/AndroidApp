Here, I built a simple ionic app with capacitor as a platform that runs natively on android and the web.
Ionic creates a default of 3 tabs which are later transformed to simple tabs of Home, News and Contact.
The android studio is used to create a virtual device and to create an APK file.

## To execute : 
### run the below command from the root directory
- ionic serve 
- or find the apk file to open it in the android emulator.
